        <h1>The Wizard of OZ!</h1>
            <p><span id="female1"></span> lived in the midst of the great <span id="State1"></span> <span id="GeoFeat1">
</span> with Uncle <span id="Male1"></span> who was a <span id="job1"></span>, and Aunt <span id="female2"></span>
who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. 
There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking <span id="Noun1"></span> 
a <span id="Noun2"></span> for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle <span id="Male1_rep"></span> 
and Aunt <span id="female2_rep"></span> had and a big bed in one corner, and <span id ="female1_rep"></span>. There was no garrets 
at all--except a small hole dugin the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case on of those great 
while winds arose,might enough to crush any buildings in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the 
middle of the <span id="Noun3"></span>, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.
<br>
<br>
When <span id='female1_rep1'></span> stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great
 <span id="color1"></span><span id="GeoFeat1_rep"></span> on every side. Not a <span id="Noun4"></span> nor 
 a <span id="Noun5"></span> broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. 
 The sun had baked the plowed land into a <span id="color1"></span> mass, with little cracks running thorugh it.
Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the 
same <span id="color1_rep"></span> color to be seen everywhere.<br> Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered 
the pain and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and <span id="color1_rep1"></span> as everything else.
